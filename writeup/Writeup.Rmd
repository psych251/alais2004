<!-- Reproducibility reports should all use this template to standardize reporting across projects. These reports will be public supplementary materials that accompany the summary report(s) of the aggregate results. -->

## Introduction

[No abstract is needed.]  Each reproducibility project will have a straightforward, no frills report of the study and reproducibility results. These reports will be publicly available as supplementary material for the aggregate report(s) of the project as a whole.  Also, to maximize project integrity, the intro and methods will be written and critiqued in advance of your attempt to reproduce the results. Introductions can be just 1-2 paragraphs clarifying the main idea of the original study, the target finding for your reproducibility attempt, and any other essential information.  It will NOT have a literature review -- that is in the original publication. You can write both the introduction and the methods in past tense.  

**Clarify key analysis of interest here**  You can also pre-specify additional analyses you plan to do.

### Justification for choice of study

This is something Justin and I have been talking about for a while. It's related to bayesian inference and we think the original analysis was quite poorly done. Cue combination has long been used as a canonical example of "optimal" bayesian inference, and has typically been the behavior to match for theoretical neural representations (i.e. probabilistic population codes). We find the lack of power of the original results quite disturbing, and many follow-up studies have found varying results.

### Anticipated challenges

Do you anticipate running into any challenges when attempting to reproduce these result(s)? If so please, list them here.

## Methods

### Description of the steps required to reproduce the results

Please describe all the steps necessary to reproduce the key result(s) of this study. 

Program the task, collect the data, fit psychometric functions to the data, and perform the significance tests following their procedure. This can be done at both the individual and population level. 

For visual stimuli, I'll use mgl (our lab's version of psych toolbox). We can make gaussian blobs and control contrast, timing, and presentation. For auditory stimuli we use head-related transfer functions from the MIT media lab. Once we get the data, we fit psychometric curves using existing toolboxes.

### Differences from original study

Explicitly describe known differences in the analysis pipeline between the original paper and yours (e.g., computing environment). The goal, of course, is to minimize those differences, but differences may occur. Also, note whether such differences are anticipated to influence your ability to reproduce the original results.

Our stimuli may differ slightly. The original paper did not provide code, so we have to make some inference about how they programmed some aspects. Curve fitting should be the same.

### Measure of success

Please describe the outcome measure for the success or failure of your reproduction and how this outcome will be computed.


### Pipeline progress

Earlier in this report, you described the steps necessary to reproduce the key result(s) of this study. Please describe your progress on each of these steps (e.g., data preprocessing, model fitting, model evaluation).


## Results

### Data preparation

Data preparation following the analysis plan.
	
```{r include=F}
### Data Preparation

#### Load Relevant Libraries and Functions

#### Import data

#### Data exclusion / filtering

#### Prepare data for analysis - create columns etc.
```

### Key analysis

The analyses as specified in the analysis plan.  

*Side-by-side graph with original graph is ideal here*

###Exploratory analyses

Any follow-up analyses desired (not required).  

## Discussion

### Summary of Reproduction Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the key analysis and assess whether you successfully reproduced it, partially reproduced it, or failed to reproduce it.  

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis of the dataset, (b) assessment of the meaning of the successful or unsuccessful reproducibility attempt - e.g., for a failure to reproduce the original findings, are the differences between original and present analyses ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the reproducibility attempt (if you contacted them).  None of these need to be long.
